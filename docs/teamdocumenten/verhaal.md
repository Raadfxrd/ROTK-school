## The story 
Arthur and the rest of the kingsguard are present at the crowning of the new queen during which she gets kidnapped. This sends the player and one other member of the kingsguard on a quest to save the queen an reclaim their honour. Two members of the kingsguard, Henry and Charles stay behind to protect the king. 

Running after the kidnappers, the main characters find out their horses have been stolen, and therefore they cannot chase the kidnappers quickly. However during the kidnappers' hurry to escape, one of them dropped a ring with the seal of the Low Lands, which after some investigation gives our characters a lead to follow.

### Kara's Vale
After traveling south towards the lowlands the main characters first come across a village named Kara's Vale. While in the town the characters can ask around if anybody has seen the group of kidnappers. After some investigation the main characters find out that some people in the village did see a group of people riding horses around the village ==> (leads to tracks which lead to the lowlands?)

Idea: A certain group in Kara's vale are conspiring with the lowlands, by defeating / interrogating members of this group some type of key can be found to open something important within the lowlands 

They also discover nobody has ever been to the Low Lands and that they have only heard of the place. Somewhere in the village a clue is found that it is neccesary to visit Volo's village in order to find access to the lowlands.
